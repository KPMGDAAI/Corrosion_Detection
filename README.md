## Project Structure

### Step 2: Clone the YOLOv5 Repository

To begin, clone the YOLOv5 repository from GitHub. YOLOv5 is an advanced object detection model, and cloning the repository gives you access to all the necessary scripts and configurations for training and deploying the model.

### Step 3: Update and Verify the Data Configuration

In this step, you will update the `data.yaml` file with the paths to your training and validation datasets. This configuration is essential for ensuring that YOLOv5 can locate and properly utilize the data for training.

### Step 4: Train the YOLOv5 Model

Train the YOLOv5 model using your dataset and the specified configurations. The training process refines the model’s ability to detect corrosion by learning from the labeled images, improving its accuracy over time.

### Step 6: Visualize Detection Results

After training, visualize the results by displaying images with detected corrosion highlighted. This step allows you to assess the model's performance and effectiveness in identifying corrosion.

### Step 7: Save the Trained Model

Save the best-trained model to Google Drive or another storage location. Preserving the trained model ensures that it is available for future use, whether for further refinement or deployment in real-world applications.

### Step 8: Upload and Test on Custom Images

Finally, upload a custom image and run the trained YOLOv5 model to detect corrosion. This step demonstrates the model’s ability to generalize to new data, showcasing its versatility and applicability in different scenarios.
